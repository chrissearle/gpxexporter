## GPX Exporter

SwiftUI based iOS app for exporting healthkit (fitness) tracks as GPX.

Heavily based on [pilif/GpxExport](https://github.com/pilif/GpxExport) for the healthkit code.

Uses [sharesheet from swiftui.gallery](https://swiftui.gallery/uploads/code/ShareSheet.html)

Licene set to MIT (same as both GpxExport and swiftui.gallery)
